        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p class="parag"><b style="font-weight: bold">Avenged Sevenfold</b> (abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy
            metal band from Huntington Beach,
            California,
            formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing
            vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist
            Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.</p>
        <p class="parag">
            Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and
            merchandise.[1] The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet
            and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. However, the band's style had evolved
            by the group's third album and first major label release, City of Evil, into a heavy metal and hard rock
            style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued
            mainstream success before their drummer, James "The Rev" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged
            Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and released and toured in
            support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010, which debuted on the top spot of the Billboard 200, their
            first number one debut.[2]
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album Hail to
            the King, which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. Hail to the
            King charted as number 1 on the Billboard 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian,
            Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former Bad Religion
            drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then
            surprise-released their seventh studio album titled The Stage on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4
            on the Billboard 200 chart in the US. The Stage is their first conceptual album and it marked another
            stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal sound.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and
            eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide,[3] and their records have received numerous
            certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution (RIAA).
            They have also created four original songs for the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, all of which were
            compiled together in the 2018 EP Black Reign. The band were ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top 50 Metal
            Bands of All Time.[4]

        <p id="bold_second_para" style="font-weight: bold;">Formation and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet (1999–2002)</p>
        <p class="parag">
            Avenged Sevenfold was formed in March 1999 in Huntington Beach, California by Matt Sanders, James Sullivan
            and Matt Wendt.[5] Although they are not a religious band, Sanders came up with the name as a reference to
            the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible, which can be found in Genesis 4:24.[6] Shortly after their
            formation, they were joined by an acquaintance from high school, Zachary Baker, who played in the punk band
            MPA (short for Mad Porn Action) at the time.[5]
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            Avenged Sevenfold's first creative output was a three-track-demo recorded in early 1999.[7][8] In early
            2000, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute to two compilations.[5] To that end, they recorded
            two new songs and released them along with the previously recorded songs on a second demo.[8] They sent this
            demo to the Belgian label Good Life Recordings and were subsequently signed.[9] Afterwards, the band
            participated in another two compilation albums, their label's GoodLife 4 and Novocaine Records' Scrape III
            compilations.[10] Around this time, Matt Wendt left for college and Justin Meacham, the previous bassist of
            Suburban Legends, joined Avenged Sevenfold. In late 2000, the foursome took on their initial stage names –
            M. Shadows, Zacky Vengeance, Justin Sane and The Rev – and recorded their debut album, Sounding the Seventh
            Trumpet.[11] In early 2001, lead guitarist and old friend Synyster Gates joined the band and they
            re-recorded the introductory track "To End the Rapture" for the album's lead-single/EP, Warmness on the
            Soul, released in April 2001. Although their debut album's release was initially planned for the same month,
            it was pushed back multiple times and eventually released on July 24, 2001, on Good Life Recordings.[12]
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            August 2001, Meacham attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup.[13][14] This
            event was the reason for Avenged Sevenfold to join the Take Action Tour in 2003.[13] During Meacham's
            hospitalization, he remained in poor condition and had to leave the band.[14] In an interview, lead singer
            M. Shadows said of Meacham that "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time,
            and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around you,
            and it makes you want to do something to prevent it from happening to other people."[14] His replacement was
            Frank Melcom, stage name Dameon Ash, who performed with the band for the following months, but does not
            appear on any releases.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            On January 18, 2002, Avenged Sevenfold left Good Life Recordings and signed with Hopeless Records.[15] They
            re-released their debut album on March 19 and also appeared on the Hopelessly Devoted To You Vol. 4 sampler
            in April. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows
            Fall.[16] They spent the year touring in support of their debut album and participated in the Vans Warped
            Tour. In September, Dameon Ash left Avenged Sevenfold and their current bassist Johnny Christ joined them,
            completing their best known line-up.[17]

        <p id="bold_second_para" style="font-weight: bold;">Waking the Fallen and City of Evil (2003–2005)</p>
        <p class="parag">
            Having found a new bassist, the group released their second studio album titled Waking the Fallen on
            Hopeless Records in August 2003. The album featured a more refined and mature sound production in comparison
            to their previous album. The band received profiles in Billboard and The Boston Globe, and again played on
            the Vans Warped and Take Action tours.[18][19][20] In 2004, Avenged Sevenfold toured again on the Vans
            Warped Tour and recorded a video for their song "Unholy Confessions" which went into rotation on MTV2's
            Headbangers Ball.[21] Shortly after the release of Waking the Fallen, Avenged Sevenfold left Hopeless
            Records and were officially signed to Warner Bros. Records on November 1, 2003.[22]
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            City of Evil, the band's third album and major label debut, was released on June 6, 2005, and debuted at No.
            30 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling over 30,000 copies in its first week of release.[23][24] It utilized
            a more classic metal sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous albums, which had been grouped into the
            metalcore genre.[25][26] The album is also notable for the absence of screamed and growled vocals; M.
            Shadows worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson—whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell—for
            months before the album's release to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone".[25][27]
            The album received positive reviews from several magazines and websites and is credited for propelling the
            band into international popularity.

                After playing Ozzfest in 2006, Avenged Sevenfold memorably beat out R&B Singers Rihanna and Chris Brown,
                Panic! at the Disco, Angels & Airwaves and James Blunt for the title of Best New Artist at the MTV Video
                Music Awards, thanks in part to their Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas-inspired song "Bat Country."[28]
                They returned to the Vans Warped Tour, this time headlining and then continued on their own "Cities of
                Evil Tour."[29] In addition, their lead single "Bat Country" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Mainstream
                Rock Charts, No.6 on the Billboard Modern Rock Charts and the accompanying video made it to No. 1 on
                MTV's Total Request Live.[30] Propelled by this success, the album sold well and became Avenged
                Sevenfold's first Gold record.[31] It was later certified platinum in August 2009. Avenged Sevenfold was
                invited to join Ozzfest tour on the main stage, alongside

            a Down for the first time in 2006.[32] That same year they also completed a worldwide tour, including the
            US, The United Kingdom (as well as mainland Europe), Japan, Australia and New Zealand. After a sixteen-month
            promotion of City of Evil, the band announced that they were cancelling their Fall 2006 tour to record new
            music.[33] In the interim, the band released their first DVD titled All Excess on July 17, 2007.[34] All
            Excess, which debuted as the No. 1 DVD in the US, included live performances and backstage footage that
            spanned the band's eight-year career. Two tribute albums, Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: Bat Wings and
            Broken Strings and Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: The String Tribute were also released in October 2007.

            On October 30, 2007, Avenged Sevenfold released their self-titled album, the band's fourth
            studio album. It debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with over 90,000 copies sold.[35] Two singles,
            "Critical Acclaim" and "Almost Easy" were released prior to the album's debut. In December 2007, an animated
            video was made for "A Little Piece of Heaven". Due to the song's controversial subject matter, however,
            Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, "Afterlife"
            and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, "Dear God", was released on June 15, 2008.
            Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies
            and was awarded "Album of the Year" at the Kerrang! Awards.[36]</p>
